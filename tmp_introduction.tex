\section{introduction}

The field of evolution tries to explain the process of speciation, the formation of species and populations in nature. In recent years  development of high throughput DNA sequencing methods has made available an increasing amount of genomes of multiple individuals from closely related species. This made available and advanced the use of data-intensive computational methods and statistical models, allowing evolutionary biologists to better understand the evolution of recently diverged species.
